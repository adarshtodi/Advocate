# Advocate


Hello, this is adarsh and hereby is my first static website entirely build by me. Its been week or so (at the time of writing this) and i have already learnt a lot of mistakes and 
bunch of codes that could be written in simplier way.I will edit them when i feel like or have enough experience that i can rewrtie everything!!


my current goal is learn but as i was checking javascipt lessions, i saw a very amazing particle.js feature that could be added in this website. in the background at those blue pages... 
gitlink is : https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/ 

i want anyone who have enough time , do make whatever changes you want however you want without editing the main data(anything in text).

thanks!
